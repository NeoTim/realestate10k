house, derived from a CC-BY video from YouTube user
SonaVisual.</i>
<p>
<b>RealEstate10K</b> is a large dataset of camera poses corresponding
to <b>10 million</b> frames derived from about <b>80,000</b> video
clips, gathered from about <b>10,000</b> YouTube videos. For each clip,
the poses form a trajectory where each pose specifies the camera
position and orientation along the trajectory. These poses are derived
by running SLAM and bundle adjustment algorithms on a large set of
videos.
<p>
This dataset helped power a SIGGRAPH 2018 paper from
Google, <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46965">Stereo
Magnification: Learning view synthesis using multiplane images</a>,
which learns to convert a narrow-baseline stereo pair into a
mini-lightfield using training data like RealEstate10K. This dataset is
intended to aid researchers in their work on view synthesis, 3D computer
vision, and beyond.
